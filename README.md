This project involves the collection of dataset(s) from various body positions for the EDA signal using MAX30001G and the python code used to conduct the experiment. The primary objectives are collecting EDA in diffrent situations of stress and training an ML algorithm to classify in two classes:STRESS, NON-STRESS.
